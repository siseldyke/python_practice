# print(round(pi)) rounds to closest whole number
# print(math.ceil(pi)) rounds UP to nearest integer
# print(math.floor(pi)) rounds DOWN to nearest integer
# print(abs(pi)) tells you how far away a number is from zero(absolute, abs for short)
# print(pow(pi, 2)) raises number to the power of the second specificied number
# print(math.sqrt(420)) square root function
# print(max(x,y,z)) finds the highest variable within
# print(min(x,y,z)) finds minimum value of variables
